/**
 * Shared types for the STS2 combat simulator.
 *
 * This file is the contract between the engine, data, strategy, stats and UI
 * tracks. Change it only through the orchestrator, never from a feature branch.
 *
 * v1 is single-target: every card targets the one enemy, every enemy move
 * targets the player. Effects therefore carry no explicit target; the source
 * decides it (a card's effects hit the enemy, an enemy move's hit the player).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Contract map (#105): which addition serves which board card. Everything
 * listed here is declared but NOT simulated yet: the validator rejects it on
 * `simulated: true` cards and the engine throws "not simulated yet" if it is
 * reached. The branch for each card implements its part in engine/, data/
 * validate.ts (move the effect out of the unsimulated set) and app/.
 *
 * Shared vocabulary: PileName, CardDestination, CardFilter, SelectMode,
 * Counter, PerCounter, Condition, CardSource, CardPool.
 *
