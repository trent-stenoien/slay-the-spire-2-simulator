/**
 * Shared types for the STS2 combat simulator.
 *
 * This file is the contract between the engine, data, strategy, stats and UI
 * tracks. Change it only through the orchestrator, never from a feature branch.
 *
 * Effects carry no explicit target; the source decides it (a card's effects hit the
 * targeted enemy, or every living enemy with `allEnemies`; an enemy move's hit the player).
 * #5: a fight may have several enemies; the strategy picks the target of each card.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Contract map (#105): which addition serves which board card. Everything
 * listed here is declared but NOT simulated yet: the validator rejects it on
 * `simulated: true` cards and the engine throws "not simulated yet" if it is
 * reached. The branch for each card implements its part in engine/, data/
 * validate/lists.ts (move the effect out of the unsimulated set) and app/.
 *
 * Shared vocabulary: PileName, CardDestination, CardFilter, SelectMode,
 * Counter, PerCounter, Condition, CardSource, CardPool.

 *                     Wiki (main v0.107.1): Expertise = "Draw cards until you have 6 (7) cards in your Hand";
 *                     the raw "Draw 2, Retain" text is beta V0.109/V0.113, so the types above fit.

 * #263 Silent Poison — PowerId `accelerant`, `envenom`, `noxiousFumes`, `corrosiveWave` (this turn),

 *                     StrategySummary.avgGold / potionRate (Hand of Greed, Alchemize).
 * #268 Silent Sly / The Hunt — PowerId `masterPlanner` (Master Planner: a Skill the player plays
 *                     gains Sly); Effect `gainCardReward` (The Hunt, inside a `fatal` conditional;
 *                     reward only); CombatResult.rewards.cardRewards.
 * #267 Silent Shiv powers / Knife Trap — PowerId `accuracy` (Accuracy: each Shiv deals +[amount]),

 *                     `all` + `upgradeFirst` (Knife Trap: play every Shiv in the Exhaust pile,
 *                     filter `cardId: 'shiv'`, from 'exhaust'). Declared, not simulated yet.
 *
 * Contract map (#215): v1 relics, potions, enemy powers, Void, golden scripting.
 * Same rule: declared, not simulated; validators list the new ids as valid but unsimulated.
 *
 * #203 Enemies      — EnemyDef.startPowers (+ EnemyAscensionOverride.startPowers);
 *                     EnemyPowerId `artifact`, `strengthPerTurn`; GameEvent `negated`.
 *                     Self-buffs reuse `enemyGainStrength`; cards added to the player's
 *                     piles reuse `addCards` (source `card`) on an enemy move.
 * #213 Slippery     — EnemyPowerId `slippery` (via EnemyDef.startPowers).
 * #303 Slow         — EnemyPowerId `slow` (declared, not simulated yet).
 * #204 Potions      — PotionDef, GameData.potions; CombatConfig.potions / RunConfig.potions;
 *                     PlayerState.potions; Strategy.usePotion + PotionUse; GameEvent `potion`.

 *                     RelicSetup, GameData.relics; CombatConfig.relics / RunConfig.relics;
 *                     PlayerState.relicCounters; GameEvent `relic`, `heal.source`;

 *                     (potion at a point); Strategy.choose (card choices, already declared).
 *                     Fixture JSON fields stay local to engine/golden/golden.test.ts.
 * #226 Once-per-fight — EnemyMove.oncePerFight (Mawler's Roar); simulated in engine/combat.ts.
 *
 * #322 Summons     — Effect `spawnEnemies`; EnemyDef.onDeath (Phrog Parasite: 4 stunned Wrigglers);
 *                     RandomPattern.weights / noRepeatMoves (Twig Slime M); CyclePattern.startBySlot
 *                     (Wriggler). Declared, not simulated yet; validators reject the new fields in data.
 * #333 Spawn log   — GameEvent `spawn` (an enemy joined mid-fight; one per spawned enemy).
 *
 * #270 Boss player debuffs — PowerId `disintegration` (end of turn, take [amount] damage), `mindRot`
 *                     (draw [amount] fewer), `sloth` (play at most [amount] cards per turn), `wasteAway`
 *                     ([amount] less energy per turn). Powers only, not status cards (Trent). An enemy
 *                     move's `applyPower` effect puts the power on the PLAYER (not the enemy).
 * #271 Knowledge Demon — Effect `playerChoice` (enemy moves only: the player takes one of the
 *                     options; Curse of Knowledge); StrategyConfig.optionChoices (per-strategy pick by
 *                     choice id, default option 0); GameEvent `heal.side` (an enemy heal). Declared, not
 *                     simulated yet; the validator rejects `playerChoice` in data.
 *
 * #5 Multi-enemy    — CombatConfig.enemyIds / RunConfig.enemyIds; CombatState.enemies (`enemy` is
 *                     the current one); StrategyView.intents; Decision / PotionUse `target`;
 *                     StrategyConfig.target + TargetPriority; `allEnemies` on applyVulnerable /
 *                     applyWeak / applyPoison; GameEvent `target`, combatStart.enemyHps. Simulated.
