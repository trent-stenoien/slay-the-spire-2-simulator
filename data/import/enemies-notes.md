# Act 1 Easy enemies — what the raw wiki export gives us

Source: `data/raw/enemies.txt` and `data/raw/intents.txt` (Cargo export, v0.107.1).
Move orders and HP ranges below were then read from each enemy's wiki page.
**Imported:** Fuzzy Wurm Crawler (FW) and Seapunk (Sp). **Blocked:** Shrinker Beetle (opener +
Shrink debuff) and Sludge Spinner (random, no repeats) need contract changes.
Intent syntax: `(base;asc L)` = base value, changed value from Ascension L on.

## Single-enemy encounters (fit the v1 single-target engine)
